Trocker gives you the latter! It blocks attempts by email trackers and won't let them track what you do with the emails you receive.\r\n- You will be amazed to see how many of the emails you receive have trackers in them!\r\n- Trocker is open source so you can trust it. Source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/trockerapp/trocker)\r\n- Trocker keeps you safe in all webmails, including Gmailâ„¢, Yahoo! and Outlook.com. It has additional capabilities in Gmail, Inbox and Outlook.com. In these 3 webmails, it has a heuristic tracker detection that detects and blocks almost any email tracking attempt, even from not well-known trackers!\r\n- Trocker is very efficient as it only gets activated when a tracker is detected.\r\n- Feel free to send us your feedback and reports any problems at <trockerapp@gmail.com>\r\n- And follow us on twitter <https://twitter.com/trockerapp>",
